# skip-youtube
UPDATE: this project has been discontinued and may not work!
i created this script to skip/mute yt ads
## better than u-block origin?
obviously no. this just mutes the ad until a skip button appears. once that appears, the ad automatically skips\
hopefully youtube still allows muting ads 

## how to use?
1. get tampermonkey
2. add this script

## how good is it?
i created it in like an hour because i was very annoyed with yt ads lately. plus the ads ruin the vibe of using youtube completely so this will hopefully help with that lol. it is probably super ineffecient. although no bugs as of now
